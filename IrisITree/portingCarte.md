# Status of the Program Logics a la Carte port

This file describes the state of the Program Logics a la Carte port relative to the Rocq implementation. The original implementation is here: <https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/itree-program-logic/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads>

Not everything should be ported to Lean. In particular, the following parts should **not** be ported:

- The trace-based adequacy
- The executable interpreters (this is subsumed by the interpreters given by the coinductive library)
- The itree semantics for HeapLang (these are already provided by the coinductive library)
- The correspondence proof of the operational semantics for HeapLang
- The `islaris` folder
- The `ITreeToTranslate` infrastructure might not be necessary to port
- The `AnswerEqDecision` infrastructure might not be necessary to port
- eutt should be replaced by normal equality (and proofs simplified accordingly)

The `islaris` folder should not be ported, all filenames below are relative to the `src` folder.
